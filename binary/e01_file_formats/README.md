File Formats
============

## Background Theory
See `File Format` on wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format

## Challenge
Craft a minimal file that will make the `file` output exactly like the following:
```
$ file /tmp/png.png
/tmp/png.png: PNG image data, 1 x 2, 47-bit gray+alpha, interlaced
```

## Rank criteria
Ordered by priority:
1. File size (smaller will win over bigger)
2. Submission time (first that submits result will win)
